wirelessTI-84
=============

Code to create a wireless link between two graphing calculators using an Arduino and an XBee.  This will emulate the TI Link Protocol.

Ardunio setup:
From a separated Texas Instruments Data Link Cable attach the red wire to pin 6 and the white wire to pin 7.  Attach the XBee normally to the transmit (tx) and receive (rx) pins on the Arduino.  Create another to complete a pair and you should be good to go!
